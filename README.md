## Background

Bananaman is based off the classic NES game called Bomberman. The game is played out by moving around a grid and placing bananas on the board. After a few seconds, the banana will explode and destroy tiles surrounding it. The purpose of the game is to destroy all monsters on the grid and arrive at the double doors which will complete the game.
